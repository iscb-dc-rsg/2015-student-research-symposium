This is the first in what we hope will become a regular series of student-driven research symposiums centered around the DC metropolitan area.\r\n\r\n[International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) Regional Student Groups (RSGs)](http://rsg.iscbsc.org/) are regional organizations designed to bring together students and post docs working in the general area of computational biology. \r\n\r\nFrom the ISCB RSG website:\r\n\r\n> In 2006, the Student Council conceptualized 'Regional Student Groups (RSGs)' with the aim to promote\r\n> interaction among students pursuing research in the field of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. \r\n> Over the past few years, SC has successfully established 26 RSGs globally and the number is on a steady\r\n> rise. Presently, the RSGs comprise of more than 1500 members across the world. RSGs conduct regional \r\n> events and meetings to promote the professional development of students. RSGs also aim to serve as a \r\n> bridge between the local industry and academia by providing career opportunities for the students.\r\n\r\nThe DC area regional student group was established in January 2015.\r\n\r\nTo find out about future DC RSG events, checkout our mailing list at: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rsg-dc-region.\r\n\r\n### Time and Location\r\n\r\n#### When\r\n\r\n9:45am - 4:00pm, Thursday May 14, 2015\r\n\r\n#### Where\r\n\r\nBiology-Psychology (BPS) 1208\r\nUniversity of Maryland\r\nCollege Park, MD 20742\r\n\r\n#### Travel\r\n\r\n##### Metro\r\n\r\nTo get here via [Metro](http://www.wmata.com/), take the green line to [College Park - University of Maryland](http://www.wmata.com/rail/station_detail.cfm?station_id=79) and take the East exit (the nearest one to the escalators) to the bus terminal.
